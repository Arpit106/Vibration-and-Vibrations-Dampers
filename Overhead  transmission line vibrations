The overhead transmission lines experience vibrations in the vertical planeand re of two ttypes.However, these  are not to be confused with the much slower swing of the 
conductors in the horizontal plane due to simple wind deflection:
* Aeoline vibrations,
* Galloping or dancing  of conductors.
The first one is of high frequency and low amplitude.The frequency is of the order of 5 to 40c/s and the amplitude of the order of 2 cms to 5 cms with a loop length of 1 
metre to 10 metres.It appears to be a condition of their formation that the wind velocit shall be quite low, 4 to 15 km/hr, that it shall be steady and free from gusts, 
uniform over a wide area and free from eddies.
The dancing  of conductors are the low frequncy high amplitdude vibrations of the conductors.The frequency is of the order of 1/4 to 3/2 cycle/sec and the ampltude is about 6 
metres.Whereas the former are forced vibrations,the latter are of the self-excitedtype.These vibrationsare caused due to then wind when it is blowa past a non-circular
conductor.Once thes starts it builds within itself and the vibrations may becomevery large and may result in flexurefailure in the conductors or there my be flashover between
conductorsof different phases.This may lead to outages in the systems.

Aeoline vibrations : While these vibrations are not of themselves harmful, however, they may give rise to troubles at points where free vibrationsis restricted.At a heavy 
anchor clamp. e.g., a travelling wave will be reflected back with a momentary bending of the cable about the mouth  of the clamp,and even theprovision of alarge radius  at 
the mouth is not a complete safeguard, since the wave will result in impact between the conductorand the radiuswhich, continuously epeated, may damage the wires.A light 
anchor clamp very freely  supportedwill reduce the hazard considerably and . in cases where vibrations is not severe, will in probably provide adequate protection at dead-
end points. If the clamp hasvery low interiaso that it can vibrate with  the conductor without substantial time lag, the bending of tthe conductor as well as the impact 
between the conductor and the clamp will be greatly diminished,thusresulting in less dangerof conductor failure.
